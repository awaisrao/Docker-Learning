Dockerfile contains a set of instructions that instructs docker which package should be installed. We can also use an existing image as a baseline for our new image.
For instance,
  FROM node:7
  RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
  WORKDIR /usr/src/app
  COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
  RUN npm install
  COPY . /usr/src/app
  CMD [ "npm", "start" ]

This Dockerfile takes node:7 image as baseline image and further builds on it by running the commands listed below it. 
RUN normally executes the command like we do on a CLI.
WORKDIR sets the directory as working directory.
COPY copies the the files from source to destination.
CMD tells which command to run when the container starts.
